"""Pros:
Good benefits, bonuses, perks and facilities.

Cons:
Right from VP to developers are south Indian (Hyderabad/Telangana) crowd and network possibly working on commission basis (check internet for what happened to Adobe and Walt Disney) to recruit their own state employees even back from India. They even fail other people during interviews, if he/she is not from their state back in India and then get someone through their network. So even if developer does not know development, he or she gets selected if from Hyderabad/Telangana.  VP happily covers all south Indian people even if they do not know anything about the job and tries to prove other guy (doesn't matter whether white or black) bad.

"""Well… what to say about my time with Enterprise?
Let’s start with something positive. A “compliment sandwich” if you will, but frankly there isn’t another positive to cover the sandwich with… so, an open-faced compliment sandwich. 
The Good: Enterprise brands itself as a place to start building a career. It is undeniably successful in that. 

The Bad: The working hours were absolutely unbelievable. Close to 12 hour days, and they operate 6 days a week, so hopefully you’ve got nothing planned pretty much forever. 
It’s ok though, as you are paid for this time! Paid barely enough to live on at that! Planning on renting an apartment AND paying an internet bill? Sorry chief, that just isn’t gonna happen for you. Especially in this housing market. 
-Do not under any circumstances expect support from the “management” team. You will not receive it and actively looking for it will brand you a problem. 
-How are your stress levels? Do they need to be catastrophically higher? Than this might not be a con for you. Ultimately, you’re just renting cars. There is no reason this basic task should be anywhere near as cortisol raising as it is, but boy-howdy, get ready for a frayed nervous system and a trip to the therapist. 

The Ugly: 
I cannot stress enough that despite everything outlined above, you are NOT paid adequately for your time or stress. This is a smart move by Enterprise as it helps reduce their already astronomically high turnover rate, by creating a situation wherein you will simply feel trapped by your inability to look for other work, and the reality that if you miss a paycheck, you’re on the street. 

Personally, I was once reprimanded harshly by my “manager” and the HR representative (weird…) for refusing to put up my own Personal Credit Card(!) to secure an alternative rental for a deeply unpleasant woman who screamed at me for an hour.

narrower across the shoulders than
yours but with the same sad slouch, the grin

the sad refusal to give in to
rain, to the hours of wasted waiting,

reason he wants. You love your brother,

the love flooding you for your brother,
who’s not beside you or behind or
ahead because he’s home trying to   
sleep off a miserable night shift
at Cadillac so he can get up
before noon to study his German.
Works eight hours a night so he can sing
Wagner, the opera you hate most,
the worst music ever invented.

you loved him, held his wide shoulders,
opened your eyes wide and said those words,
and maybe kissed his cheek? You’ve never
done something so simple, so obvious,

not because you’re jealous or even mean

It was a joke among employees that if you got fired (we were constantly threatened by managers in this way) or quit, you could just join the Goodwill jobs program and get a better job somewhere else.

Some of the things I witnessed:

- Managers making yelling at, calling names and encouraging gossip and bullying employees with disabilities. Often employees were yelled at or criticized for reasons related to their disability. There was very little support or understanding.
- Quality items thrown in the trash at request of manager because Goodwill needed to make more money. We were instructed to go through bins quickly and take out specific items that would generate profit in the online auction. Everything else thrown in trash. I begged manager to save an antique glass washboard, refused.
- Managers routinely intimidate and bully employees. Hours are cut if you complain or create problems. Threats of being fired common. Threats of being fired used to scare workers into working faster, beyond what is normal, so store can make money.
- Little or no work incentives. It was more common to get a pay cut than a pay raise. Senior employees not recognized or rewarded.
- I was trained to do my job a specific way. It was common for manager to change the tasks of my job or do something different even if it made the job more inefficient or compromised the customer experience. You never knew what to expect. You didn't ask questions bc you'd be yelled at or threatened to be fired.

Growth in management outside of Enterprise is through internal highering, so you are only training for being an Enterprise Manager, don't be fooled.

For example, you, your co-employee assistant and management crew in the area will go to mandatory meetings on top of 50-60 hour work weeks.(Look up the labor law lawsuits with Enterprise on Google)  Meanwhile, upper management was promoted based off their ability to have no integrity with customers.  They do this by selling themselves and a product with no integrity.  The communication and workplace is based off of lies and un-accomplishable expectations, no matter the circumstance.  This causes you to hate customers, your manager, and even yourself. Next, the higher you grow with Enterprise, the faster you are released, unless you have luck in numbers.  Most numbers are based on military, dealership, traveling, and city economic growth numbers.  You have no ability to change the amount of growth or average salary in a city.  Also, discrimination is a part of the culture.  You will notice that females will get promoted faster and will be hired more often than males. This keeps them an equal opportunity employer, while the women intuitively leave causing more turnover.

The worst working environment, where the favoritism and  discrimination is at its peak.
Human Resources manager is very unprofessional and racist. Hilton regards only those employees who kiss up to managers. They are rewarded as the employees of the year. I am surprised why not people investigate the employees in person secretly instead through the employee survey. Hilton definitely holds the survey website and changes it into their own words. Claiming that ""Hilton is the best place to work,"" is totally wrong. The management is pathetic and believes on favoritism. You never get your right and fair treatment.
Most of the shop stewards are 50% with employees and 50% with management.
I am surprised why not any media or any agency go there and investigate about working environment, even should make videos with their secret cameras. Most of them keep their mouths shut because they have a fear that the company kick them out and they are scared to open their mouths and they stay quiet.
And that's the reason company gets advantage of their weakness.
Hilton hotel is full of politics, every department has grouping and managers do not even give a care to resolve the proper fairly, they made decisions on false basis.
Please, I request to high authorities to investigate the matter and solve the issues of innocent people who are suffering there with health problems and stay quiet because of fear of losing their job.

- Managers making yelling at, calling names and encouraging gossip and bullying employees with disabilities. Often employees were yelled at or criticized for reasons related to their disability. There was very little support or understanding.
- Quality items thrown in the trash at request of manager because Goodwill needed to make more money. We were instructed to go through bins quickly and take out specific items that would generate profit in the online auction. Everything else thrown in trash. I begged manager to save an antique glass washboard, refused.
- Managers routinely intimidate and bully employees. Hours are cut if you complain or create problems. Threats of being fired common. Threats of being fired used to scare workers into working faster, beyond what is normal, so store can make money.
- Little or no work incentives. It was more common to get a pay cut than a pay raise. Senior employees not recognized or rewarded.
- I was trained to do my job a specific way. It was common for manager to change the tasks of my job or do something different even if it made the job more inefficient or compromised the customer experience. You never knew what to expect.

They are constantly adding more and more tasks for you to perform for the caller, taking away from other departments and adding to the call center all under the guise of “keeping transfers down during the call.” The merchant statements are deliberately deceptive with terrible selling points by their Business Consultants, who most times, are never heard from again by the merchant despite repeated calls to Bank of America. Also, First Data has ridiculous standards and procedures (quality and time focused) for their call reps to follow in order to remain “compliant” to keep your low paying job. EVERY second during your 8 hr shift is micro managed. You are pretty much expected to not be off your phone at all except for 2 short breaks and one unpaid 1/2 hr lunch. Not only are you expected to be “logged in” during this time but IF you remain on your call with your merchant (customers) past your scheduled break and lunch time , it counts against your “compliance” and will be marked against a final daily scoring of your time, which all factors into a low (if possible) increase annually.

They don’t care if you do 99% good job, they will only focus on the 1% that you missed and punch you for it.
Only team leaders and their “close friends” can do whatever they want, totally unfair treatment should be expected. team leaders and their “close friends” go out to smoke, and you are expected to stay and take calls for hours, the moment you go to the bathroom, they will start looking for you. If the team leaders know that you complained to a manager, they will be harder on you, be careful about this TLS will take it serious.

"""I was laid off due to the pandemic and sought a position at Goodwill as a processor to supplement income. I also have 10+ years experience in volunteering with non-profits and was excited to work in a business that cares about the community... My experience working at Goodwill was traumatic. I was appalled at the way employees are treated. Profit was more important than people or customer service. It was a joke among employees that if you got fired (we were constantly threatened by managers in this way) or quit, you could just join the Goodwill jobs program and get a better job somewhere else.

Some of the things I witnessed:

- Managers making yelling at, calling names and encouraging gossip and bullying employees with disabilities. Often employees were yelled at or criticized for reasons related to their disability. There was very little support or understanding.
- Quality items thrown in the trash at request of manager because Goodwill needed to make more money. We were instructed to go through bins quickly and take out specific items that would generate profit in the online auction. Everything else thrown in trash. I begged manager to save an antique glass washboard, refused.
- Managers routinely intimidate and bully employees. Hours are cut if you complain or create problems. Threats of being fired common. Threats of being fired used to scare workers into working faster, beyond what is normal, so store can make money.
- Little or no work incentives. It was more common to get a pay cut than a pay raise. Senior employees not recognized or rewarded.
- I was trained to do my job a specific way. It was common for manager to change the tasks of my job or do something different even if it made the job more inefficient or compromised the customer experience. You never knew what to expect. You didn't ask questions bc you'd be yelled at or threatened to be fired.
- Stresseful and unsafe conditions for donation attendants.
- Low pay.
- Managers not responsive to feedback.""",1.5

"""Booz Allen boosts themselves to be above the rest and to be part of an elite group of consultants, but the real fact is far from that. Management is distant from employees, company values change too often, company looks only at the bottom line and forgets about the people that bring in that revenue, poor advancement opportunities, salary competitiveness is below average due to the high costs of overhead and expected company profit, and the list can go on and on. 

Leadership, at least at the Quantico area location, is immature and lacks a lot of the basic leadership skills needed to be an effective and powerful leader. Management changes in this area quite often giving the impression that no one wants to be on this team long. If you are planning on joining the Booz Allen team, be aware that you must negotiate your best possible deal up front as when you get in you are pretty much locked in to a bleak future. Another interesting fact, the turn over rate here at the Quantico team is very high. Not only myself, but 6 to 7 other team members have left the firm and never looked back. This alone gives solid testament that something just isn't right here. Just be warned is all I have to say. 

* Advice to Management - Increase leadership skills, look to help employees further their career and help them advance, stay connected and not distant, stop changing core values and company slogans just to be changing them and stick with one and solidify it. Make Booz Allen worthwhile to work for not just for today but for a career long choice. Don't treat certain teams in one manner and others in a different manner due to their location. Stop the double standard rules with employees with more years versus those with little years. We all wear the same badge so it is imperative that leadership ensures that all practices, values, rules and regulations are followed across the board completely.""",1.5

"""Well… what to say about my time with Enterprise?
Let’s start with something positive. A “compliment sandwich” if you will, but frankly there isn’t another positive to cover the sandwich with… so, an open-faced compliment sandwich. 
The Good: Enterprise brands itself as a place to start building a career. It is undeniably successful in that. 

The Bad: The working hours were absolutely unbelievable. Close to 12 hour days, and they operate 6 days a week, so hopefully you’ve got nothing planned pretty much forever. 
It’s ok though, as you are paid for this time! Paid barely enough to live on at that! Planning on renting an apartment AND paying an internet bill? Sorry chief, that just isn’t gonna happen for you. Especially in this housing market. 
-Do not under any circumstances expect support from the “management” team. You will not receive it and actively looking for it will brand you a problem. 
-How are your stress levels? Do they need to be catastrophically higher? Than this might not be a con for you. Ultimately, you’re just renting cars. There is no reason this basic task should be anywhere near as cortisol raising as it is, but boy-howdy, get ready for a frayed nervous system and a trip to the therapist. 

The Ugly: 
I cannot stress enough that despite everything outlined above, you are NOT paid adequately for your time or stress. This is a smart move by Enterprise as it helps reduce their already astronomically high turnover rate, by creating a situation wherein you will simply feel trapped by your inability to look for other work, and the reality that if you miss a paycheck, you’re on the street. 

Personally, I was once reprimanded harshly by my “manager” and the HR representative (weird…) for refusing to put up my own Personal Credit Card(!) to secure an alternative rental for a deeply unpleasant woman who screamed at me for an hour.

I was appalled at the way employees are treated. Profit was more important than people or customer service. It was a joke among employees that if you got fired (we were constantly threatened by managers in this way) or quit, you could just join the Goodwill jobs program and get a better job somewhere else.

Some of the things I witnessed:

- Managers making yelling at, calling names and encouraging gossip and bullying employees with disabilities. Often employees were yelled at or criticized for reasons related to their disability. There was very little support or understanding.
- Quality items thrown in the trash at request of manager because Goodwill needed to make more money. We were instructed to go through bins quickly and take out specific items that would generate profit in the online auction. Everything else thrown in trash. I begged manager to save an antique glass washboard, refused.
- Managers routinely intimidate and bully employees. Hours are cut if you complain or create problems. Threats of being fired common. Threats of being fired used to scare workers into working faster, beyond what is normal, so store can make money.
- Little or no work incentives. It was more common to get a pay cut than a pay raise. Senior employees not recognized or rewarded.
- I was trained to do my job a specific way. It was common for manager to change the tasks of my job or do something different even if it made the job more inefficient or compromised the customer experience. You never knew what to expect. You didn't ask questions bc you'd be yelled at or threatened to be fired.
- Stresseful and unsafe conditions for donation attendants.
- Low pay.
- Managers not responsive to feedback.""",1.5

"""I was laid off due to the pandemic and sought a position at Goodwill as a processor to supplement income. I also have 10+ years experience in volunteering with non-profits and was excited to work in a business that cares about the community... My experience working at Goodwill was traumatic. I was appalled at the way employees are treated. Profit was more important than people or customer service. It was a joke among employees that if you got fired (we were constantly threatened by managers in this way) or quit, you could just join the Goodwill jobs program and get a better job somewhere else.

Some of the things I witnessed:

- Managers making yelling at, calling names and encouraging gossip and bullying employees with disabilities. Often employees were yelled at or criticized for reasons related to their disability. There was very little support or understanding.
- Quality items thrown in the trash at request of manager because Goodwill needed to make more money. We were instructed to go through bins quickly and take out specific items that would generate profit in the online auction. Everything else thrown in trash. I begged manager to save an antique glass washboard, refused.
- Managers routinely intimidate and bully employees. Hours are cut if you complain or create problems. Threats of being fired common. Threats of being fired used to scare workers into working faster, beyond what is normal, so store can make money.
- Little or no work incentives. It was more common to get a pay cut than a pay raise. Senior employees not recognized or rewarded.
- I was trained to do my job a specific way. It was common for manager to change the tasks of my job or do something different even if it made the job more inefficient or compromised the customer experience. You never knew what to expect. You didn't ask questions bc you'd be yelled at or threatened to be fired.
- Stresseful and unsafe conditions for donation attendants.
- Low pay.
- Managers not responsive to feedback.""",1.5

"""Well… what to say about my time with Enterprise?
Let’s start with something positive. A “compliment sandwich” if you will, but frankly there isn’t another positive to cover the sandwich with… so, an open-faced compliment sandwich. 
The Good: Enterprise brands itself as a place to start building a career. It is undeniably successful in that. 

The Bad: The working hours were absolutely unbelievable. Close to 12 hour days, and they operate 6 days a week, so hopefully you’ve got nothing planned pretty much forever. 
It’s ok though, as you are paid for this time! Paid barely enough to live on at that! Planning on renting an apartment AND paying an internet bill? Sorry chief, that just isn’t gonna happen for you. Especially in this housing market. 
-Do not under any circumstances expect support from the “management” team. You will not receive it and actively looking for it will brand you a problem. 
-How are your stress levels? Do they need to be catastrophically higher? Than this might not be a con for you. Ultimately, you’re just renting cars. There is no reason this basic task should be anywhere near as cortisol raising as it is, but boy-howdy, get ready for a frayed nervous system and a trip to the therapist. 

The Ugly: 
I cannot stress enough that despite everything outlined above, you are NOT paid adequately for your time or stress. This is a smart move by Enterprise as it helps reduce their already astronomically high turnover rate, by creating a situation wherein you will simply feel trapped by your inability to look for other work, and the reality that if you miss a paycheck, you’re on the street. 

Personally, I was once reprimanded harshly by my “manager” and the HR representative (weird…) for refusing to put up my own Personal Credit Card(!) to secure an alternative rental for a deeply unpleasant woman who screamed at me for an hour.

In a 6 month span of time I will lose access to necessary systems without warning, internal teams do not have any checks and balances on granting access or removing access. Internal oversight teams and HR/WFM teams can take months to respond to basic day to day work requests. Getting access during onboarding has taken months to years for multiple systems. In review for promotion they will advise you are exemplary and setting the bar for your peers but deny you promotion, in waiting for a discussion on next steps meetings will be pushed out indefinitely leaving tenured employees in the dark on what to do to meet requirements they have already been advised they meet.

Compensation has no concern with getting tenured people the money they deserve, resulting in those tenured employees receiving 20% - 50% less than new hires who are lower title. They do the standard run around of ""you shouldn't be discussing compensation"" as the response when these concerns are escalated.

The buildings are these empty desolate offices that instill a sense of deep depression and hollowness and they are desperately struggling to force everyone into these cages to work in misery surrounded by distraction and full of hollow pointless meetings.

Supervisor: Totally incompetent. He can't communicate yet micromanages. It was absurd that he even checked my email despite his poor ability to speak and write proper English. He always loses himself in verbiage, extending a 1hr meeting to 3hrs easy. He cannot talk constructively, so topics tend to be discursive and desultory, leaving all participants obfuscated and lost at the end. He's a toady to his boss, who leaves this guy unleashed and unchecked and has no idea what really is going on within the team. Maybe he skillfully equivocates things to his boss. Then, he succeeds, as he's ""trusted"".

Co-workers: Nice people who are accustomed to a slow environment. No one is stressed out, so there's plenty of room in his/her mind to be nice to others. They tend to think that what they have at Aflac is best in the world. However, I've seen people who left Aflac as soon as they got an MBA degree.

Salary: Average or a bit lower end of average. If you are in finance, don't go work at Aflac. It's a low end.

Job: Audit job at Aflac is a joke. All ""projects"" are travesties in one way or another. If you take a close look, audit at Aflac is nothing but a sinecure. 
Audit is essentially peripheral, i.e., non-core relative to the company's main business. You chat with people in other teams, collect some info, and prepare reports, which have no true value in it. So, people in audit inevitably tend to aggrandize their jobs to maintain their pride, existence, and job itself. As a result, all projects run by audit focus on their complacency. Once you realize the veracity of what I wrote here, you'll agree with me saying that the audit job at Aflac is a joke.

Upward Mobility: Very slim at audit. For two years of my stay there, I've seen nobody who got promoted to senior level. Audit is by nature a back office, so companies pay less attention.""",1.5

The training is extremely lacking for the scope of tasks you are expected to perform during a call. They are constantly adding more and more tasks for you to perform for the caller, taking away from other departments and adding to the call center all under the guise of “keeping transfers down during the call.” The merchant statements are deliberately deceptive with terrible selling points by their Business Consultants, who most times, are never heard from again by the merchant despite repeated calls to Bank of America. Also, First Data has ridiculous standards and procedures (quality and time focused) for their call reps to follow in order to remain “compliant” to keep your low paying job. EVERY second during your 8 hr shift is micro managed. You are pretty much expected to not be off your phone at all except for 2 short breaks and one unpaid 1/2 hr lunch. Not only are you expected to be “logged in” during this time but IF you remain on your call with your merchant (customers) past your scheduled break and lunch time , it counts against your “compliance” and will be marked against a final daily scoring of your time, which all factors into a low (if possible) increase annually.

Firstly, their scanners and equipment are old, out-dated and prehistoric. I find it comical how the managerial staff gets brand new office furniture every year (nothing wrong with the previous ones) when they can't even supply their workers with decent equipment. How were we supposed to efficiently do our jobs with broken down junk? 

Some of their rules and regulations are beyond ridiculous. Imagine getting written up for being only a minute late? Then there's their absurd ""10-14-60"" hour rule. Good news is, you can get lots of overtime, but yet overtime is discouraged anyway. Sure makes lots of sense to me!

Their ""safety training programs"" were comical at best. Employees operating forklifts with expired certification (or no certification) was quite common. Let's just hope their driver's are still licensed to operate company trucks on the road! 

Another funny thing regarding DHL's safety program is their ""safety award"". Their workers are ""entitled"" to receive a monetary award (placed on a Global Cash Card) upon performance without injuries, accidents or incidents. The company claims that they'll give you so many $$ per month or year for ""perfect safety performance"" yet they seldom deliver on their promise. Like the old saying goes ""you can't have it both ways"", but DHL always manages to do it!

Your chances of becoming a full-timer are next to impossible unless you want to wait 10-15 years before some of the senior members start to die off or retire. If you start off as a lousy part-timer, you'll get no benefits whatsoever. No paid leave, no sick leave, no vacation time. You're simply treated as a slave.

I was appalled at the way employees are treated. Profit was more important than people or customer service. It was a joke among employees that if you got fired (we were constantly threatened by managers in this way) or quit, you could just join the Goodwill jobs program and get a better job somewhere else.

Some of the things I witnessed:

- Managers making yelling at, calling names and encouraging gossip and bullying employees with disabilities. Often employees were yelled at or criticized for reasons related to their disability. There was very little support or understanding.
- Quality items thrown in the trash at request of manager because Goodwill needed to make more money. We were instructed to go through bins quickly and take out specific items that would generate profit in the online auction. Everything else thrown in trash. I begged manager to save an antique glass washboard, refused.
- Managers routinely intimidate and bully employees. Hours are cut if you complain or create problems. Threats of being fired common. Threats of being fired used to scare workers into working faster, beyond what is normal, so store can make money.
- Little or no work incentives. It was more common to get a pay cut than a pay raise. Senior employees not recognized or rewarded.
- I was trained to do my job a specific way. It was common for manager to change the tasks of my job or do something different even if it made the job more inefficient or compromised the customer experience. You never knew what to expect. You didn't ask questions bc you'd be yelled at or threatened to be fired.

"""Well… what to say about my time with Enterprise?
Let’s start with something positive. A “compliment sandwich” if you will, but frankly there isn’t another positive to cover the sandwich with… so, an open-faced compliment sandwich. 
The Good: Enterprise brands itself as a place to start building a career. It is undeniably successful in that. 

The Bad: The working hours were absolutely unbelievable. Close to 12 hour days, and they operate 6 days a week, so hopefully you’ve got nothing planned pretty much forever. 
It’s ok though, as you are paid for this time! Paid barely enough to live on at that! Planning on renting an apartment AND paying an internet bill? Sorry chief, that just isn’t gonna happen for you. Especially in this housing market. 
-Do not under any circumstances expect support from the “management” team. You will not receive it and actively looking for it will brand you a problem. 
-How are your stress levels? Do they need to be catastrophically higher? Than this might not be a con for you. Ultimately, you’re just renting cars. There is no reason this basic task should be anywhere near as cortisol raising as it is, but boy-howdy, get ready for a frayed nervous system and a trip to the therapist. 

The Ugly: 
I cannot stress enough that despite everything outlined above, you are NOT paid adequately for your time or stress. This is a smart move by Enterprise as it helps reduce their already astronomically high turnover rate, by creating a situation wherein you will simply feel trapped by your inability to look for other work, and the reality that if you miss a paycheck, you’re on the street. 

Personally, I was once reprimanded harshly by my “manager” and the HR representative (weird…) for refusing to put up my own Personal Credit Card(!) to secure an alternative rental for a deeply unpleasant woman who screamed at me for an hour.

In a 6 month span of time I will lose access to necessary systems without warning, internal teams do not have any checks and balances on granting access or removing access. Internal oversight teams and HR/WFM teams can take months to respond to basic day to day work requests. Getting access during onboarding has taken months to years for multiple systems. In review for promotion they will advise you are exemplary and setting the bar for your peers but deny you promotion, in waiting for a discussion on next steps meetings will be pushed out indefinitely leaving tenured employees in the dark on what to do to meet requirements they have already been advised they meet.

Compensation has no concern with getting tenured people the money they deserve, resulting in those tenured employees receiving 20% - 50% less than new hires who are lower title. They do the standard run around of ""you shouldn't be discussing compensation"" as the response when these concerns are escalated.

The buildings are these empty desolate offices that instill a sense of deep depression and hollowness and they are desperately struggling to force everyone into these cages to work in misery surrounded by distraction and full of hollow pointless meetings.

"""I was laid off due to the pandemic and sought a position at Goodwill as a processor to supplement income. I also have 10+ years experience in volunteering with non-profits and was excited to work in a business that cares about the community... My experience working at Goodwill was traumatic. I was appalled at the way employees are treated. Profit was more important than people or customer service. It was a joke among employees that if you got fired (we were constantly threatened by managers in this way) or quit, you could just join the Goodwill jobs program and get a better job somewhere else.

Some of the things I witnessed:

- Managers making yelling at, calling names and encouraging gossip and bullying employees with disabilities. Often employees were yelled at or criticized for reasons related to their disability. There was very little support or understanding.
- Quality items thrown in the trash at request of manager because Goodwill needed to make more money. We were instructed to go through bins quickly and take out specific items that would generate profit in the online auction. Everything else thrown in trash. I begged manager to save an antique glass washboard, refused.
- Managers routinely intimidate and bully employees. Hours are cut if you complain or create problems. Threats of being fired common. Threats of being fired used to scare workers into working faster, beyond what is normal, so store can make money.
- Little or no work incentives. It was more common to get a pay cut than a pay raise. Senior employees not recognized or rewarded.
- I was trained to do my job a specific way. It was common for manager to change the tasks of my job or do something different even if it made the job more inefficient or compromised the customer experience. You never knew what to expect. You didn't ask questions bc you'd be yelled at or threatened to be fired.
- Stresseful and unsafe conditions for donation attendants.
- Low pay.
- Managers not responsive to feedback.""",1.5

"""You'd imagine that a multi billion dollar global company would have some of the basics figured out. Things like; Access to systems, onboarding, training, promotion requirements, project management. You would however be wrong. 

In a 6 month span of time I will lose access to necessary systems without warning, internal teams do not have any checks and balances on granting access or removing access. Internal oversight teams and HR/WFM teams can take months to respond to basic day to day work requests. Getting access during onboarding has taken months to years for multiple systems. In review for promotion they will advise you are exemplary and setting the bar for your peers but deny you promotion, in waiting for a discussion on next steps meetings will be pushed out indefinitely leaving tenured employees in the dark on what to do to meet requirements they have already been advised they meet.

Compensation has no concern with getting tenured people the money they deserve, resulting in those tenured employees receiving 20% - 50% less than new hires who are lower title. They do the standard run around of ""you shouldn't be discussing compensation"" as the response when these concerns are escalated.

The buildings are these empty desolate offices that instill a sense of deep depression and hollowness and they are desperately struggling to force everyone into these cages to work in misery surrounded by distraction and full of hollow pointless meetings. The internal organization is designed entirely around giving 1 or 2 people dozens of responsibilities that create roadblocks for thousands of employees and does nothing to hold those select individual responsible for actually doing their job.

"""Well… what to say about my time with Enterprise?
Let’s start with something positive. A “compliment sandwich” if you will, but frankly there isn’t another positive to cover the sandwich with… so, an open-faced compliment sandwich. 
The Good: Enterprise brands itself as a place to start building a career. It is undeniably successful in that. 

The Bad: The working hours were absolutely unbelievable. Close to 12 hour days, and they operate 6 days a week, so hopefully you’ve got nothing planned pretty much forever. 
It’s ok though, as you are paid for this time! Paid barely enough to live on at that! Planning on renting an apartment AND paying an internet bill? Sorry chief, that just isn’t gonna happen for you. Especially in this housing market. 
-Do not under any circumstances expect support from the “management” team. You will not receive it and actively looking for it will brand you a problem. 
-How are your stress levels? Do they need to be catastrophically higher? Than this might not be a con for you. Ultimately, you’re just renting cars. There is no reason this basic task should be anywhere near as cortisol raising as it is, but boy-howdy, get ready for a frayed nervous system and a trip to the therapist. 

The Ugly: 
I cannot stress enough that despite everything outlined above, you are NOT paid adequately for your time or stress. This is a smart move by Enterprise as it helps reduce their already astronomically high turnover rate, by creating a situation wherein you will simply feel trapped by your inability to look for other work, and the reality that if you miss a paycheck, you’re on the street. 

Personally, I was once reprimanded harshly by my “manager” and the HR representative (weird…) for refusing to put up my own Personal Credit Card(!) to secure an alternative rental for a deeply unpleasant woman who screamed at me for an hour.

Just as a galvanic anode is a piece of dissimilar metal tacked onto the metallic structure of a building or a boat's hull, to protect the structure from corrosion, by attracting the corrosion to this anode, these openings are there for the purpose of attracting the next round of layoffs.  Protecting the long-time-there, job veterans, that is.  2 people in that latter slot have now been laid off, while the others (senior ranking engineers), always stay.  The senior ranking engineers will keep it that way, by whatever methods they can get away with.  The office politics there is the 2nd worst I have ever seen in more than 30 years in the EE business.

First off: the call rep fields irate merchant calls re: the deceptive practices of Bank of America. We are identifying ourselves as Bank of America employees when in fact we are strictly First Data employees. The training is extremely lacking for the scope of tasks you are expected to perform during a call. They are constantly adding more and more tasks for you to perform for the caller, taking away from other departments and adding to the call center all under the guise of “keeping transfers down during the call.” The merchant statements are deliberately deceptive with terrible selling points by their Business Consultants, who most times, are never heard from again by the merchant despite repeated calls to Bank of America. Also, First Data has ridiculous standards and procedures (quality and time focused) for their call reps to follow in order to remain “compliant” to keep your low paying job. EVERY second during your 8 hr shift is micro managed. You are pretty much expected to not be off your phone at all except for 2 short breaks and one unpaid 1/2 hr lunch. Not only are you expected to be “logged in” during this time but IF you remain on your call with your merchant (customers) past your scheduled break and lunch time , it counts against your “compliance” and will be marked against a final daily scoring of your time, which all factors into a low (if possible) increase annually. The management are extremely robotic, cold personalities with little to no interpersonal skills. When you voice your concerns, of course you are labeled a negative detractor.

"""This company and the call center positions have to be just about the worse job I’ve ever encountered in 30 plus years working. First off: the call rep fields irate merchant calls re: the deceptive practices of Bank of America. We are identifying ourselves as Bank of America employees when in fact we are strictly First Data employees. The training is extremely lacking for the scope of tasks you are expected to perform during a call. They are constantly adding more and more tasks for you to perform for the caller, taking away from other departments and adding to the call center all under the guise of “keeping transfers down during the call.” The merchant statements are deliberately deceptive with terrible selling points by their Business Consultants, who most times, are never heard from again by the merchant despite repeated calls to Bank of America. Also, First Data has ridiculous standards and procedures (quality and time focused) for their call reps to follow in order to remain “compliant” to keep your low paying job. EVERY second during your 8 hr shift is micro managed. You are pretty much expected to not be off your phone at all except for 2 short breaks and one unpaid 1/2 hr lunch. Not only are you expected to be “logged in” during this time but IF you remain on your call with your merchant (customers) past your scheduled break and lunch time , it counts against your “compliance” and will be marked against a final daily scoring of your time, which all factors into a low (if possible) increase annually. The management are extremely robotic, cold personalities with little to no interpersonal skills. When you voice your concerns, of course you are labeled a negative detractor.

I worked for over 10 years in FedEx sales. It is a great place to start a career but not worth staying. the training there is great but that is about where it ends.  Get good pay coming in because you are stuck with it. The old guard is retiring and you can see the leadership change coming down the pipe and it's not good. Over the last five years reps were asked to take a pay cut to save jobs and we did. A few year later FedEx reports record profits but yet they tell the sales force that things are tight and that a good cost of living raise is 2% and that is if you are meeting or exceeding plan. They are able to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on new computer software programs that pile on additional paperwork to the reps but can't afford to pay a decent cost of living raise. Interesting. If you want to get promoted you must live in one of these cities because if you don't, forget about getting a shot at management: Memphis, Dallas, Pittsburgh, LA, Atlanta, or Chicago. Also promotion has less to do with performance than it does politics. Keep that in mind. Take on higher ups' pet projects and you can move up no matter what your sales performance is. Doing what is right is good as long as it is not hard. If it involves someone actually having to do real work, something hard, forget about it. Get used to hearing ""there is nothing I can do, I can't change the system"", even if it means you will get hosed out of thousands of dollars in bonus money that has been earned. What you have to realize as a rep is that even though you are getting hosed because of a computer error affecting your territory, if it does not have an effect on your managers or directors bonus it isn't going to happen. Doesn't matter if it is the right thing to do or not.

It was a joke among employees that if you got fired (we were constantly threatened by managers in this way) or quit, you could just join the Goodwill jobs program and get a better job somewhere else.

Some of the things I witnessed:

- Managers making yelling at, calling names and encouraging gossip and bullying employees with disabilities. Often employees were yelled at or criticized for reasons related to their disability. There was very little support or understanding.
- Quality items thrown in the trash at request of manager because Goodwill needed to make more money. We were instructed to go through bins quickly and take out specific items that would generate profit in the online auction. Everything else thrown in trash. I begged manager to save an antique glass washboard, refused.
- Managers routinely intimidate and bully employees. Hours are cut if you complain or create problems. Threats of being fired common. Threats of being fired used to scare workers into working faster, beyond what is normal, so store can make money.
- Little or no work incentives. It was more common to get a pay cut than a pay raise. Senior employees not recognized or rewarded.
- I was trained to do my job a specific way. It was common for manager to change the tasks of my job or do something different even if it made the job more inefficient or compromised the customer experience. You never knew what to expect. You didn't ask questions bc you'd be yelled at or threatened to be fired.

He always loses himself in verbiage, extending a 1hr meeting to 3hrs easy. He cannot talk constructively, so topics tend to be discursive and desultory, leaving all participants obfuscated and lost at the end. He's a toady to his boss, who leaves this guy unleashed and unchecked and has no idea what really is going on within the team. Maybe he skillfully equivocates things to his boss. Then, he succeeds, as he's ""trusted"".

Co-workers: Nice people who are accustomed to a slow environment. No one is stressed out, so there's plenty of room in his/her mind to be nice to others. They tend to think that what they have at Aflac is best in the world. However, I've seen people who left Aflac as soon as they got an MBA degree.

Salary: Average or a bit lower end of average. If you are in finance, don't go work at Aflac. It's a low end.

Job: Audit job at Aflac is a joke. All ""projects"" are travesties in one way or another. If you take a close look, audit at Aflac is nothing but a sinecure. 
Audit is essentially peripheral, i.e., non-core relative to the company's main business. You chat with people in other teams, collect some info, and prepare reports, which have no true value in it. So, people in audit inevitably tend to aggrandize their jobs to maintain their pride, existence, and job itself. As a result, all projects run by audit focus on their complacency.

At 10:40 AM EST, I receive a phone call telling me that they are pulling me from the class because my background check still hadn't come back yet.

I completely lost it and told them off and let them know exactly how unprofessional I thought it was that they tell me I am hired and give me a start date only to take it away from me the very day I am supposed to begin training.  The 'recruiter' tells me that it would be three weeks before they could reassign me.  THREE WEEKS!  I am now unemployed and have to wait another three freaking weeks to start 'training'.  I got angry and hung up on her.  After cooling off a while, I sent her an email apologizing and explained my situation to them.
3. The next day (Tuesday August 25th) I receive an email telling me that I am set to begin training today (August 26th).  I got excited and thought my apology was accepted and everything was good to go.  So I login and sit through the 'roll call' only to be one of eight people whose name wasn't called.  I was then told to leave the room and that one of the trainers would call me within fifteen minutes to let me know what was going on.  TWO HOURS LATER I get a phone call from the same woman I spoke with on Monday.  She tells me that I will NOT be allowed to work at all for Convergys because I had a bad attitude.

"""Well… what to say about my time with Enterprise?
Let’s start with something positive. A “compliment sandwich” if you will, but frankly there isn’t another positive to cover the sandwich with… so, an open-faced compliment sandwich. 
The Good: Enterprise brands itself as a place to start building a career. It is undeniably successful in that. 

The Bad: The working hours were absolutely unbelievable. Close to 12 hour days, and they operate 6 days a week, so hopefully you’ve got nothing planned pretty much forever. 
It’s ok though, as you are paid for this time! Paid barely enough to live on at that! Planning on renting an apartment AND paying an internet bill? Sorry chief, that just isn’t gonna happen for you. Especially in this housing market. 
-Do not under any circumstances expect support from the “management” team. You will not receive it and actively looking for it will brand you a problem. 
-How are your stress levels? Do they need to be catastrophically higher? Than this might not be a con for you. Ultimately, you’re just renting cars. There is no reason this basic task should be anywhere near as cortisol raising as it is, but boy-howdy, get ready for a frayed nervous system and a trip to the therapist. 

The Ugly: 
I cannot stress enough that despite everything outlined above, you are NOT paid adequately for your time or stress. This is a smart move by Enterprise as it helps reduce their already astronomically high turnover rate, by creating a situation wherein you will simply feel trapped by your inability to look for other work, and the reality that if you miss a paycheck, you’re on the street. 

Personally, I was once reprimanded harshly by my “manager” and the HR representative (weird…) for refusing to put up my own Personal Credit Card(!) to secure an alternative rental for a deeply unpleasant woman who screamed at me for an hour.

Also, First Data has ridiculous standards and procedures (quality and time focused) for their call reps to follow in order to remain “compliant” to keep your low paying job. EVERY second during your 8 hr shift is micro managed. You are pretty much expected to not be off your phone at all except for 2 short breaks and one unpaid 1/2 hr lunch. Not only are you expected to be “logged in” during this time but IF you remain on your call with your merchant (customers) past your scheduled break and lunch time , it counts against your “compliance” and will be marked against a final daily scoring of your time, which all factors into a low (if possible) increase annually.

- Quality items thrown in the trash at request of manager because Goodwill needed to make more money. We were instructed to go through bins quickly and take out specific items that would generate profit in the online auction. Everything else thrown in trash. I begged manager to save an antique glass washboard, refused.
- Managers routinely intimidate and bully employees. Hours are cut if you complain or create problems. Threats of being fired common. Threats of being fired used to scare workers into working faster, beyond what is normal, so store can make money.
- Little or no work incentives. It was more common to get a pay cut than a pay raise. Senior employees not recognized or rewarded.
- I was trained to do my job a specific way. It was common for manager to change the tasks of my job or do something different even if it made the job more inefficient or compromised the customer experience. You never knew what to expect.

"""Well… what to say about my time with Enterprise?
Let’s start with something positive. A “compliment sandwich” if you will, but frankly there isn’t another positive to cover the sandwich with… so, an open-faced compliment sandwich. 
The Good: Enterprise brands itself as a place to start building a career. It is undeniably successful in that. 

The Bad: The working hours were absolutely unbelievable. Close to 12 hour days, and they operate 6 days a week, so hopefully you’ve got nothing planned pretty much forever. 
It’s ok though, as you are paid for this time! Paid barely enough to live on at that! Planning on renting an apartment AND paying an internet bill? Sorry chief, that just isn’t gonna happen for you. Especially in this housing market. 
-Do not under any circumstances expect support from the “management” team. You will not receive it and actively looking for it will brand you a problem. 
-How are your stress levels? Do they need to be catastrophically higher? Than this might not be a con for you. Ultimately, you’re just renting cars. There is no reason this basic task should be anywhere near as cortisol raising as it is, but boy-howdy, get ready for a frayed nervous system and a trip to the therapist. 

The Ugly: 
I cannot stress enough that despite everything outlined above, you are NOT paid adequately for your time or stress. This is a smart move by Enterprise as it helps reduce their already astronomically high turnover rate, by creating a situation wherein you will simply feel trapped by your inability to look for other work, and the reality that if you miss a paycheck, you’re on the street. 

Personally, I was once reprimanded harshly by my “manager” and the HR representative (weird…) for refusing to put up my own Personal Credit Card(!) to secure an alternative rental for a deeply unpleasant woman who screamed at me for an hour.

"""I worked as an Audit Manager at Aflac for two years until December 2019. My recommendation: Don't work in audit in Aflac. Here's why.

Supervisor: Totally incompetent. He can't communicate yet micromanages. It was absurd that he even checked my email despite his poor ability to speak and write proper English. He always loses himself in verbiage, extending a 1hr meeting to 3hrs easy. He cannot talk constructively, so topics tend to be discursive and desultory, leaving all participants obfuscated and lost at the end. He's a toady to his boss, who leaves this guy unleashed and unchecked and has no idea what really is going on within the team. Maybe he skillfully equivocates things to his boss. Then, he succeeds, as he's ""trusted"".

Co-workers: Nice people who are accustomed to a slow environment. No one is stressed out, so there's plenty of room in his/her mind to be nice to others. They tend to think that what they have at Aflac is best in the world. However, I've seen people who left Aflac as soon as they got an MBA degree.

Salary: Average or a bit lower end of average. If you are in finance, don't go work at Aflac. It's a low end.

Job: Audit job at Aflac is a joke. All ""projects"" are travesties in one way or another. If you take a close look, audit at Aflac is nothing but a sinecure. 
Audit is essentially peripheral, i.e., non-core relative to the company's main business. You chat with people in other teams, collect some info, and prepare reports, which have no true value in it. So, people in audit inevitably tend to aggrandize their jobs to maintain their pride, existence, and job itself. As a result, all projects run by audit focus on their complacency. Once you realize the veracity of what I wrote here, you'll agree with me saying that the audit job at Aflac is a joke.

Upward Mobility: Very slim at audit. For two years of my stay there, I've seen nobody who got promoted to senior level. Audit is by nature a back office, so companies pay less attention.""",1.5

1.	The penny wise, pound foolish mentality.   For example, the cheapest possible new phones were purchased for our switch to VOIP.   Less than a year after our cutover those phones are obsolete and new phones must be purchased.
2.	The ineffectuality of management.  Because of a corporate policy to avoid paying unemployment claims, no employee is ever fired for their poor work.  Employees are only terminated for violations of company policy, i.e. lateness, absence, or email policy.  Bad employees know this and take advantage; good employees see that and lose motivation.
3.	In the past few years GEICO has taken to hiring supervisors and managers from outside of the company resulting in management that is unaware of what the associates do in their day to day work and are therefore unable to coach the associates effectively.  It has also created a middle management team that is more ambition than substance.
4.	Management is convoluted and top heavy.  I cannot tell you how many people I answer to, because I don’t know.  The hierarchy is constantly changing as are the members of management.

In a 6 month span of time I will lose access to necessary systems without warning, internal teams do not have any checks and balances on granting access or removing access. Internal oversight teams and HR/WFM teams can take months to respond to basic day to day work requests. Getting access during onboarding has taken months to years for multiple systems. In review for promotion they will advise you are exemplary and setting the bar for your peers but deny you promotion, in waiting for a discussion on next steps meetings will be pushed out indefinitely leaving tenured employees in the dark on what to do to meet requirements they have already been advised they meet.

Compensation has no concern with getting tenured people the money they deserve, resulting in those tenured employees receiving 20% - 50% less than new hires who are lower title. They do the standard run around of ""you shouldn't be discussing compensation"" as the response when these concerns are escalated.

The buildings are these empty desolate offices that instill a sense of deep depression and hollowness and they are desperately struggling to force everyone into these cages to work in misery surrounded by distraction and full of hollow pointless meetings.

"""Well… what to say about my time with Enterprise?
Let’s start with something positive. A “compliment sandwich” if you will, but frankly there isn’t another positive to cover the sandwich with… so, an open-faced compliment sandwich. 
The Good: Enterprise brands itself as a place to start building a career. It is undeniably successful in that. 

The Bad: The working hours were absolutely unbelievable. Close to 12 hour days, and they operate 6 days a week, so hopefully you’ve got nothing planned pretty much forever. 
It’s ok though, as you are paid for this time! Paid barely enough to live on at that! Planning on renting an apartment AND paying an internet bill? Sorry chief, that just isn’t gonna happen for you. Especially in this housing market. 
-Do not under any circumstances expect support from the “management” team. You will not receive it and actively looking for it will brand you a problem. 
-How are your stress levels? Do they need to be catastrophically higher? Than this might not be a con for you. Ultimately, you’re just renting cars. There is no reason this basic task should be anywhere near as cortisol raising as it is, but boy-howdy, get ready for a frayed nervous system and a trip to the therapist. 

The Ugly: 
I cannot stress enough that despite everything outlined above, you are NOT paid adequately for your time or stress. This is a smart move by Enterprise as it helps reduce their already astronomically high turnover rate, by creating a situation wherein you will simply feel trapped by your inability to look for other work, and the reality that if you miss a paycheck, you’re on the street. 

Personally, I was once reprimanded harshly by my “manager” and the HR representative (weird…) for refusing to put up my own Personal Credit Card(!) to secure an alternative rental for a deeply unpleasant woman who screamed at me for an hour.

They are constantly adding more and more tasks for you to perform for the caller, taking away from other departments and adding to the call center all under the guise of “keeping transfers down during the call.” The merchant statements are deliberately deceptive with terrible selling points by their Business Consultants, who most times, are never heard from again by the merchant despite repeated calls to Bank of America. Also, First Data has ridiculous standards and procedures (quality and time focused) for their call reps to follow in order to remain “compliant” to keep your low paying job. EVERY second during your 8 hr shift is micro managed. You are pretty much expected to not be off your phone at all except for 2 short breaks and one unpaid 1/2 hr lunch. Not only are you expected to be “logged in” during this time but IF you remain on your call with your merchant (customers) past your scheduled break and lunch time , it counts against your “compliance” and will be marked against a final daily scoring of your time, which all factors into a low (if possible) increase annually.

I quit GEICO in November 2019. Its May 2020, and I'm still upset about how I was treated in this office. Working for this office was the biggest mistake of my life. 

* My agent told me she disagreed with my lifestyle. 
* I complained about getting harassed at work on social media... because now this is the SECOND time some idiot thinks its okay to to speak freely about how they're ignorant. 
* Someone sent my complaint to management... even tho my social media is private.
* They demoted me. 
* My manager tells me he wishes he can fire me... and smiles in my face as he demoted me. (I've finally had enough and call him out to his face.) 
* I cry and get upset (they took 10k a year away from me and did NOTHING to address my side of the situation.) I have a panic attack in my car. 
* I try to talk to the AVP to see if anyone has my back. She tells me I'm making her uncomfortable... which... ok... I was crying an upset.... but I wasn't violent or anything. I'm a nice, happy person, usually!

The Bad: The working hours were absolutely unbelievable. Close to 12 hour days, and they operate 6 days a week, so hopefully you’ve got nothing planned pretty much forever. 
It’s ok though, as you are paid for this time! Paid barely enough to live on at that! Planning on renting an apartment AND paying an internet bill? Sorry chief, that just isn’t gonna happen for you. Especially in this housing market. 
-Do not under any circumstances expect support from the “management” team. You will not receive it and actively looking for it will brand you a problem. 
-How are your stress levels? Do they need to be catastrophically higher? Than this might not be a con for you. Ultimately, you’re just renting cars. There is no reason this basic task should be anywhere near as cortisol raising as it is, but boy-howdy, get ready for a frayed nervous system and a trip to the therapist. 

The Ugly: 
I cannot stress enough that despite everything outlined above, you are NOT paid adequately for your time or stress.

Well, I was recruited by direct HR approach last year (typically for +VP grades)
              However, I can call myself very lucky as HR on-board me although:
- I was disciplinary terminated, sucked @BofA in 15’ focusing on the last employer instead, recommendation. Lucky this hasn’t impacted my screening, most banks perform much detailed checks further in history!
- I was disciplinary terminated @BofA in 15’ focusing on the last employer instead, recommendation. Lucky this hasn’t impacted my screening, most banks perform much detailed checks further in history!
- I'm 100% non-TARGET (Uni, MBAs, background etc)I have low (3.6/5.0) M.Sc. Marketing/Accounting of Eastern Europe UNi, non target even there, 2nd degree- but never finished back at home, started ACCA which failed after 1st exam, same goes to FCA etc. 

An obvious trick was do buy instead MBA(nb fails those!) the cheapest London’s MBA(100% pass rates+ CMI incl. for free) nb cares, West London at the end my programme which I had to extended, luckily merged with City Uni - what confused HR as it is still same low quality with other slightly better label). 
Most banks won’t even care about those, somehow GS/Morgan HR’s need tick this off for any promotion, won’t even consider it as any value as you can easily cheat and outsource most assignments to copywriters like most ppl did. 
- My communication skills although average as I have never studied English language as my 1st foreign language, nor my Eastern accent luckily hasn’t impacted my chances. Know sectors at FS are very biased on this in London as well as expat nationalities (policies one thing, reality another)
In other words not only geniuses get ED roles but also like my case process masters too!""",3.0

- I was disciplinary terminated @BofA in 15’ focusing on the last employer instead, recommendation. Lucky this hasn’t impacted my screening, most banks perform much detailed checks further in history!
- I'm 100% non-TARGET (Uni, MBAs, background etc)I have low (3.6/5.0) M.Sc. Marketing/Accounting of Eastern Europe UNi, non target even there, 2nd degree- but never finished back at home, started ACCA which failed after 1st exam, same goes to FCA etc. 

An obvious trick was do buy instead MBA(nb fails those!) the cheapest London’s MBA(100% pass rates+ CMI incl. for free) nb cares, West London at the end my programme which I had to extended, luckily merged with City Uni - what confused HR as it is still same low quality with other slightly better label). 
Most banks won’t even care about those, somehow GS/Morgan HR’s need tick this off for any promotion, won’t even consider it as any value as you can easily cheat and outsource most assignments to copywriters like most ppl did. 
- My communication skills although average as I have never studied English language as my 1st foreign language, nor my Eastern accent luckily hasn’t impacted my chances. Know sectors at FS are very biased on this in London as well as expat nationalities (policies one thing, reality another)
In other words not only geniuses get ED roles but also like my case process masters too!""",3.0

Making you do a TON of work that is mostly work that is thrown at you so you have something to do. I can't tell you the amount of times my department was perfect and my manager would just walk in and move something and then tell me to fix the whole wall. He moved something slightly. They find ways to make you do brainless tasks because they can't stand when you stand there or go play a new piece of gear that comes in, that's another thing I was not allowed under any circumstance to play... at all, I thought this was a MUSIC store where we are all musicians who spent years honing the skills we had to play the way we did. We got new gear from NAMM and we weren't allowed to try it out and see how it played or worked, which is vital in sales to help customers play to their full potential. Knowledge on the  product didn't seem to matter to GC, they were solely focused on doing brainless activities to ""keep us busy"". As for the Ops department I felt horrible for them because they had to do all this crap to make sure the sales floor ran smoothly and they got crap pay to do it. They got mad at me for doing training module which you know helps me do my job, God forbid, we do anything to improve our way of doing the job that we were paid and hired to do.  Because of the environment and commission structure, no one ever worked as a team, it was literally every man or woman for themselves, worst of all my manager was always making fun of me or insulting me.

We got new gear from NAMM and we weren't allowed to try it out and see how it played or worked, which is vital in sales to help customers play to their full potential. Knowledge on the  product didn't seem to matter to GC, they were solely focused on doing brainless activities to ""keep us busy"".

The immediate supervisors were great and the company was a good company to work for but these changes effectively capped earning potential and you are very limited on what you can do...I signed on originally to to earn $75-80K and with the current structure I'll earn between $40-55K...$40K with promised overtime that is subject to change and $55K with hitting every sales target that has to be quantified in a complicated sales system, and maintain a budget off of pre-pandemic numbers. You don't automatically get credit if your customer buys something, you have to quantify it beforehand and claim it, not only that you're competing with other employees for the same sales. Ecolab has turned into a miserable place to work. My best guess is that they are saving about 30% on labor, between the new system and layoffs. I hope the customers realize this and start negotiating for better prices.""",2.5

              However, I can call myself very lucky as HR on-board me although:
- I was disciplinary terminated, sucked @BofA in 15’ focusing on the last employer instead, recommendation. Lucky this hasn’t impacted my screening, most banks perform much detailed checks further in history!
- I was disciplinary terminated @BofA in 15’ focusing on the last employer instead, recommendation. Lucky this hasn’t impacted my screening, most banks perform much detailed checks further in history!
- I'm 100% non-TARGET (Uni, MBAs, background etc)I have low (3.6/5.0) M.Sc. Marketing/Accounting of Eastern Europe UNi, non target even there, 2nd degree- but never finished back at home, started ACCA which failed after 1st exam, same goes to FCA etc. 

An obvious trick was do buy instead MBA(nb fails those!) the cheapest London’s MBA(100% pass rates+ CMI incl. for free) nb cares, West London at the end my programme which I had to extended, luckily merged with City Uni - what confused HR as it is still same low quality with other slightly better label). 
Most banks won’t even care about those, somehow GS/Morgan HR’s need tick this off for any promotion, won’t even consider it as any value as you can easily cheat and outsource most assignments to copywriters like most ppl did.

"""I have worked for Fidelity for almost 15 years.  The company is a good company to work for but lags its peers in compensation in the financial industry. Fidelity has outsourced a significant amount of work to India and QA testing to China.  While the company isn't a high tech company unless you walk into an investor center you're probably familiar with Fidelity through work with a 401k or through the web for IRA's and trades.  All of this is technology driven versus face to face or calling a phone representative.  

While fidelity has a tremendous amount of phone reps to handle your call, almost all interactions start off via the web.  So while Fidelity is a good and stable place to work for the most part it is not the place to work if you're after salary alone and it is not the place to work if you want a creative environment like Google or another high tech company. 

So if you are not looking for a cutting edge tech company and are not trading stocks, etc, but want to answer phones Fidelity is a fantastic place to work versus many call centers.  If you're interested in doing a good job for good pay in good working conditions but not advancing your career or your skill set Fidelity is also a very good company to work for.

Fidelity is a 365/24 company as the web never sleeps, but has a discourse in understanding that not everyone works on Boston time, therefore if you're in TX or in India you are either working late or early or both in the same day.

Last of all, Fidelity way underpays IT workers outside of the Northeast in comparison.  For example the cost of living in its NH office is comparable to the cost of living in NC and TX but they pay significantly less outside of New England for the same work.  That said of course they pay people in India way less but the cost of living is significantly less there too.

I like Fidelity, else I wouldn't have worked for them for 15 years.  However, they come up short in many areas unfortunately.""",3.0

If looking cool is a priority, a job in management isn’t the place to be. Working at DG isn’t extremely hard, but the work is never finished. I considered that a blessing as I like staying busy. Unfortunately, because the manager wanted to be cool, she wouldn’t communicate with her assistant manager, but with her 21-year-old favorite person who worked there. Conflicting information was scattered around to where you couldn’t determine if you were working a puzzle or playing Go Fish. I applied for the job knowing it was entry-level paying minimum wage.

They took my retirement, my job at times with layoffs, they keep some employees in expensive areas in poverty, they do not respect experience and now in their most profitable time they are laying off Maintenance Controllers. Maintenance Controllers are crucial for aircraft safety. Delta maintains about 160 controllers to cover about 1000 aircraft to include Hawaiian Airlines. This is a 24/7/365 job that requires much skill and knowledge, so this places only about 25 controllers on duty at any one time. 

Why should this be concerning? Delta Air Lines has been running short staffed for 5+ years in Maintenance Control. This is a critical position to review work before flight, answer the call for in flight emergencies, catch errors made in maintenance and direct repair for critical issues. Take for perspective dispatchers, they are linked to the number of flights for safety. Delta's current leadership as of 2015  Maintenance Control is sufficient with workers off the street, protecting unskilled new hires and eliminating long term experienced employees for the benefit of cutting costs and making more managers. At this time Delta Maintenance Control has 6 managers, 6 coordinators who double the managers up, 2 bosses over them and 1 director. That is 15 bosses for 160 people. On any given weekday there are 5 managers on the floor for 25 workers. This is why Delta is laying off critical positions, so there can be more real management.
